title: "3.1 Set Miner Stakes"
---

As designed in [Phala Token Economics](https://files.phala.network/phala-token-economics-en.pdf), each miner is required to stake at least 1620 PHA per core before mining starts. On testnet Vendetta, to better perform a stress test on Phala network and allow more miners to participate, Phala network will automatically stake for miners after they register. 

However, to score a higher rank in the Miner Race, you can earn more points by using better hardwares, staking more tPHA, or simply running for a longer period, e.t.c.. Rules and tutorials of how to stake more PHA to your miner will be published soon before the race is launched.

### The Mining Lending Protocol

This protocol is designed to lowered the entrance cost of staking: a miner may turn to other PHA holders, and invite them to stake for him or her. Thus he or she could start mining with less cost. As a payback, part of the mining profits will be shared with the nominators. 

The detailed introduction and tutorial of Mining Nomination will be published shortly.
